defmodule Gringotts.Gateways.Checkout do
  @moduledoc """
  [checkout][home] gateway implementation.

  ## Instructions!

  ***This is an example `moduledoc`, and suggests some items that should be
  documented in here.***

  The quotation boxes like the one below will guide you in writing excellent
  documentation for your gateway. All our gateways are documented in this manner
  and we aim to keep our docs as consistent with each other as possible.
  **Please read them and do as they suggest**. Feel free to add or skip sections
  though.

  If you'd like to make edits to the template docs, they exist at
  `templates/gateway.eex`. We encourage you to make corrections and open a PR
  and tag it with the label `template`.

  ***Actual docs begin below this line!***

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  > List features that have been implemented, and what "actions" they map to as
  > per the checkout gateway docs.
  > A table suits really well for this.

  ## Optional or extra parameters

  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `Keyword` list `opts` to supply
  optional arguments for transactions with the gateway.

  > List all available (ie, those that will be supported by this module) keys, a
  > description of their function/role and whether they have been implemented
  > and tested.
  > A table suits really well for this.

  ## Registering your checkout account at `Gringotts`

  Explain how to make an account with the gateway and show how to put the
  `required_keys` (like authentication info) to the configuration.

  > Here's how the secrets map to the required configuration parameters for checkout:
  > 
  > | Config parameter | checkout secret   |
  > | -------          | ----           |
  > | `:secret_key`     | **SecretKey**  |

  > Your Application config **must include the `[:secret_key]` field(s)** and would look
  > something like this:
  > 
  >     config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Checkout,
  >         secret_key: "your_secret_secret_key"

  ## Scope of this module

  > It's unlikely that your first iteration will support all features of the
  > gateway, so list down those items that are missing.

  ## Supported currencies and countries

  > It's enough if you just add a link to the gateway's docs or FAQ that provide
  > info about this.

  ## Following the examples

  1. First, set up a sample application and configure it to work with checkout.
  - You could do that from scratch by following our [Getting Started][gs] guide.
      - To save you time, we recommend [cloning our example
      repo][example] that gives you a pre-configured sample app ready-to-go.
          + You could use the same config or update it the with your "secrets"
          as described [above](#module-registering-your-monei-account-at-checkout).

  2. Run an `iex` session with `iex -S mix` and add some variable bindings and
  aliases to it (to save some time):
  ```
  iex> alias Gringotts.{Response, CreditCard, Gateways.Checkout}
  iex> card = %CreditCard{first_name: "Jo",
                          last_name: "Doe",
                          number: "4200000000000000",
                          year: 2099, month: 12,
                          verification_code: "123", brand: "VISA"}
  ```

  > Add any other frequently used bindings up here.

  We'll be using these in the examples below.
